📚 What I Learned as a Web Developer by Building This To-Do App:
1. HTML (Structure & Layout)
  =>Creating a structured page using:
  =>form, input, and button for adding tasks.
  =>ul and li elements for displaying the task list.
  =>Assigning IDs and classes to elements for styling and JavaScript manipulation.

2. CSS (Design & Styling)
  => Designing a clean, minimal UI:
  =>Styling buttons, input fields, and the task list.
  =>Using hover effects for interactivity.
  =>Applying flexbox or grid for layout alignment.
  =>Styling completed tasks with strike-through or different colors.
  =>Creating and styling a progress bar that updates dynamically.

3. JavaScript (Functionality & Logic)
  =>DOM Manipulation:
    +Selecting elements with getElementById / querySelector.
    +Dynamically creating and appending new task items.
    +Updating the UI when tasks are added, edited, or deleted.
  =>Event Handling:
    +Listening for button clicks and form submissions.
    +Using addEventListener to trigger functions like addTask(), deleteTask(), editTask().
    +Handling the "Enter" key to quickly add tasks.
  =>Conditionals & Loops:
    +Checking if a task is empty before adding.
    +Iterating through tasks to calculate progress.
  =>Task Editing & State Management:
    +Allowing users to edit tasks only if not completed.
    +Toggling between completed / not completed states.
  =>Progress Tracking:
    +Updating the progress bar dynamically as tasks change.
